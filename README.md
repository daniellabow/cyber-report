This report presents findings and recommendations from the comprehensive cybersecurity assessment conducted for NARO, Inc., a fictional nonprofit organization used to examine the state of cybersecurity measures that apply across industries. The focus of the assessment was to examine the cybersecurity posture currently in place within the organization, to identify potential weaknesses in that posture, and provide actionable recommendations on how it can improve its security structure. This applies to the modern-day digital world where it is envisaged that there is a range of cyber threats which could compromise sensitive information and hamper operations. Good cybersecurity practices are therefore called for in view of protection against any potential attacks.
The assessment utilized the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as an overarching guide and organized methodology for managing cybersecurity risk, organized around five core functions: Identification, Protection, Detection, Response, and Recovery. Using the framework was intended to provide the assessment team with additional insight into the cybersecurity landscape at NARO, Inc., coupled with recommendations tailored to the needs of that organization.
